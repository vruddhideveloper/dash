This code defines a performance dashboard using the Dash framework, which allows for interactive visualizations and data tables. Key features include:

1. **Date and Latency Selection**: Users can select a date from a `DatePicker` and choose a latency type from a dropdown to view specific data.
2. **Toggle Views**: A button toggles between two views—data tables showing performance and timing metrics, or a histogram that visualizes the latency distribution.
3. **Dynamic Data Loading**: The app loads CSV data based on the selected date and processes timestamps to calculate latencies between different time points (T1 to T5).
4. **Custom Styling**: The app includes custom CSS for a clean and modern UI with elements like buttons, tables, and charts styled for clarity and ease of use.

The app is set up with callbacks that update the content dynamically based on user input, offering a real-time dashboard experience.

The dashboard includes a **histogram view**, which can be toggled by the "Toggle View" button. Here's a breakdown of how the histogram is displayed:

1. **Latency Dropdown**: The dashboard has a dropdown (`latency-dropdown`) that allows the user to choose the type of latency they want to view in the histogram. Available options include:
   - `T5-T4 Latency`
   - `T4-T3 Latency`
   - `T3-T2 Latency`
   - `T2-T1 Latency`
   - `T5-T2 Latency`

2. **Toggle View Button**: When the "Toggle View" button is clicked, it switches between two display modes:
   - **Table View**: Shows two tables displaying performance metrics and timing metrics.
   - **Histogram View**: Displays a histogram based on the latency type selected from the dropdown.

3. **Histogram Display**: In the histogram view, a Plotly graph shows the distribution of the selected latency. This chart updates dynamically based on the user’s choice from the dropdown.

   - The histogram plots the frequency of latency values for the selected type, showing minimum, average, and maximum values in the statistics section next to the chart.

Here’s where users can view the histogram:

- When the user clicks the "Toggle View" button and switches to the histogram view (when the click count is odd), a chart representing the distribution of the selected latency is shown with a detailed statistical summary.
- Users can select different latency types from the dropdown, and the histogram will update accordingly.

This structure allows for flexible exploration of latency data in both tabular and visual formats.
